            <h3>Research Vision</h3>
            
            <p>
                Welcome to the lab of regenerative biology at <a href="https://iribhm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRIBHM</a>, <a href="https://www.ulb.be/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ULB</a>. We are interested in understanding the ability of organs to recover from injuries and stress. For example, we are able to heal a cut to our finger, even if it happens multiple times. Our blood regenerates after blood donation within a day or two. In ancient Greek mythology, Prometheus was sentenced to having half of his liver eaten by an eagle every day, but the liver would regenerate during the night – highlighting the almost infinite regenerative capacity of the liver. We are fascinated by such robustness in regenerative systems - which are a hallmark of a dynamic biological system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            To understand the robustness of regenerative systems, we explore three main themes: <b>adaptation, plasticity and memory</b>. Our ongoing efforts are explained <a target="_self" href="https://sumeetpalsingh.github.io/research">here</a>. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            For our experimental model, we use Zebrafish, which posses amazing regenerative abilities. It is able to recover from complete loss of hepatocytes (liver cells), bone or pancreatic beta-cells. We utilize its super-natural regenerative ability to explore our themes, with the hope that the lessons we learn can be translated to improve outcomes of human injury.
