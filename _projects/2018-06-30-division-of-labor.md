## How do cells multi-task?

Our research interest lies in understanding the organizational principles underlying a cellular community. Similar to human society, cellular societies (organs) are required to efficiently multi-task in order to survive in an ever-changing environment. We want to understand how cells distribute the various tasks among themselves to achieve multi-tasking.

>The prime reason why cells need to multi-task is that one cell cannot be optimal at all the tasks at once. 

Thus, cells need to focus on a specific task, which tunes its gene expression towards the specialty. The process may be dynamic, with cells continuously shifting roles with each other. However, at a given point in time, the <span style="color:coral">**tradeoff**</span> in cellular responsibilities segregates a cellular community. [Such tradeoffs have been suggested for cancer cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24213474). For example, cancer cells either invest in [cell division or tissue-invasion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19713745), as each of the tasks requires a specific gene regulatory network that is not compatible with each other. This tradeoff, termed [‘Go or grow’](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20610469), nicely captures the requirement for adaptability, and hence diversity, for optimal survival.
