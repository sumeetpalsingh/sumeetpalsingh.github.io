## ULB Single-cell Meetup (January, 2021)

A single-cell user and interest group meetup! 

A platform for obtaining feedback on project setup, analysis; logistics for single-cell experiment, new tool development and most importantly, debugging not-so-good experiments. 

The meetup will be in conjugation with the Gosselies campus, and we hope to bring all the expertise and interest in single-cell at ULB under one roof for an evening.

Time: 16:00 onwards
