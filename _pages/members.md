<span style="color:coral">**Elif Eski**</span>, the lab's first PhD student, is joining on 01 November, 2019! She obtained her M.Sc. degree from Bogazici University, Turkey. During her master's thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Stefan H. Fuss](http://neurobio.boun.edu.tr/), she focussed on the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during regenerative neurogenesis in adult zebrafish olfactory epithelium.

<span style="color:coral">**Sumeet Pal Singh, PhD**</span> is an alumni of [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). He graduated in 2004 with a B.Tech. degree in [Biological Sciences and Bioengineering](http://www.iitk.ac.in/bsbe/). Directly after bachelor's degree, he joined the PhD program at Duke University, USA where he performed his doctorate under the supervision of [Dr. Kenneth Poss](https://sites.duke.edu/posslab/). For his thesis, Sumeet worked on the cellular basis of bone regeneration in the zebrafish fin amputation model.  
  
For post-doctoral work, Sumeet started work on planarian model system, a fascinating organism with extraordinary regenerative capacity, in the lab of [Dr. Jochen Rink](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/jochen-rink/research-focus/) at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics ([MPI-CBG](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/home/)), Germany.  
  
For his second post-doc, he returned to zebrafish research in the lab of [Dr. Nikolay Ninov](https://www.crt-dresden.de/research/research-groups/core-groups/group-leaders/dr-nikolay-ninov/) at Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden ([CRTD](https://www.crt-dresden.de/about-us/)), Germany. Focussing on the pancreatic beta-cells, Sumeet uncovered latent heterogeneity in the beta-cell population. For this, he developed several transgenic reagents to interrogate the proliferative and functional differences among individual cells. He was awarded an [EFSD/Lilly Young Investigator Fellowship](http://www.europeandiabetesfoundation.org/efsdlilly-young-investigator.html) for his efforts.  
  
In 2019, Sumeet was awarded the Mandat d’impulsion scientifique - mobilité Ulysse ([MISU](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/fr/reglements-guides#bourses-mandats)) by Le Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique ([FNRS](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/fr/)) to start his group at [IRIBHM](https://iribhm.org/), part of [ULB](https://www.ulb.be/en) in Brussels, Belgium.
