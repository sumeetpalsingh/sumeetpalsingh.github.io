#### PhD

We are offering a PhD position starting 01 October, 2019.

Download [the advertisement for fully funded PhD position][1]

The PhD student will be involved in live-imaging intercellular signalling pathways in the thyroid gland (https://sumeetpalsingh.github.io/project/live-imaging), and for developing tools modulating cAMP signalling in thyroid follicular cells. The tool development would additional lead to new models of hypo- and hyperthyroid disease models.

#### Post-Doc

Support for Marie Curie Post-Doc Position in ‘Investigating the cell fate decisions during differentiation of ES-cells to thyroid gland using single-cell technologies’

>Interested in cell therapy? Excited about discovering regulators of a differentiation program? Then, this could be an exciting post-doc opportunity for you.

The research group of [Dr Sabine Costagliola](https://costalab.ulb.ac.be/) along with us are jointly offering support for Marie Curie Post-Doc application on using single-cell technologies to understand the directed differentiation of ES-cells into thyroid organoid.  

The lab of Dr. Costagliola was [the first to generate functional thyroid gland from mouse ES cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23051751). With our expertise in single-cell transcriptome analysis, the project will aim to define the trajectory from naïve ES cells to functional thyroid gland using single-cell genomics. We hope to understand the bottlenecks and hurdles in the differentiation process so as to overcome them and generate a more efficient differentiation process.

For further information, please refer to this website: [https://if-at-ulb.ulb.be/call-information](https://if-at-ulb.ulb.be/call-information).
Please contact us at the earliest with your CV and a letter of motivation via e-mail to scostag@ulb.ac.be and sumeetpalsingh@gmail.com.
